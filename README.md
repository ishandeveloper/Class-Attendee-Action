<h3> Class Attender Action</h3>
<hr>
</center>

This repository is dedicated to a GitHub Action for running a cron job, every morning at 11 AM to attend my super boring **OOPS** Classes.

### SECRETS

  Make sure to add 3 secrets in your project, by going to 
  
  <pre><b>Project Settings > Secrets > New Secret.</b></pre>

  The Format for these 3 secrets is as below :

  <pre>
    # Contains Your Google Account Email Address
    <b>USER_EMAIL</b>     
    
    # Contains Your Google Account Password
    <b>USER_PASSWORD</b>  

    # Add the Link for the Google Meet you'd like to join.
    <b>MEET_LINK</b>      
  </pre>
